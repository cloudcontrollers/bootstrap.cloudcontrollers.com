Cloud Controllers Community AMIs are designed to randomly generate new passwords for 
key administrative controls each time you launch a NEW instance of the AMI (not on reboot).
This ensures all instances of this AMI in use have a different 
set of security credentials.


The randomly generated credentials for this instance of 
Cloud Controllers Community Alfresco AMI:


Unix System Users: 	root			ROOTPASSWORD				     					

MySQL Users and Related Configuration Files:
					
					root			MYSQLPASSWORD

											

Other Config File Encryption keys or passwords:
/home/ubuntu/duncil 						OTHERPASSWORD



(NOTE: the duncil file is NOT used by any application on this
server- it is a placeholder for configuration files which require unique 
encryption keys or other passwords in their configuration files.)

The script which generates these passwords is located at 
/usr/local/sbin/(server)_scripts/passwordsetup.py
